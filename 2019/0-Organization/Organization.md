# Lecture
Every week at 11:40am in S101|A03.

[.build-lists: true]

- We are going to discuss algorithms (static analyses) that can be used to detect code smells and security vulnerabilities by analyzing the (binary) code of applications.
- The concepts generally apply to a very wide range of languages and programming language paradigms.
- The examples and analyses are primarily concerned with Java (Bytecode). 
- The language that we use for implementing analyses is [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org).

The lecture slides can be found at: [https://github.com/stg-tud/apsa](https://github.com/stg-tud/apsa/tree/master/2019).

^ The lecture slides are basically markdown files that are presented using [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com). The final PDF is rendered using [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com) after preprocessing them using the following [sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) program:
```bash
/usr/bin/sed -E -e 's/^\[\..+\:.+\]//' -e 's/^\^[[:space:]]//' -e 's/#[[:space:]]\[fit\]/#/' -e 's/[$][$]/$/g' -e 's/[\\]([\{]|[\}])/\\\\\1/g'
```
The program basically removes all non-standard markdown commands which are only used/required by Deckset.
Hence, if you have suggestions for improvement or if you find typos or more significant issues don't hesitate to create [issues](https://github.com/stg-tud/apsa/issues). Pull requests can easily be created using the Website and are very welcome.

# Exam

- We will have a closed-book exam on Monday, 22nd Jul. 2019 at 11:00 in S101/A1
- The exam will be 60 minutes.
- (There will be no bonus.)

---

# Exercise
Every week we will have ~60minutes of lecture and ~30minutes exercises. 

Some exercises will just be theory and some will require you to comprehend and write concrete static analyses. The analyses will be developed using the [OPAL](www.opal-project.de) framework.

The exercises will help you to prepare for the exam.
